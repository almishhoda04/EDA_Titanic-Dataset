# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis of the Titanic Dataset

# 📌 Objective

The goal of this project is to perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis  on the cleaned Titanic dataset from the Data_Cleaning_Preprocessing notebook, identifying patterns, trends, and key insights using visualizations and summary statistics.

# 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** Cleaned Titanic dataset [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/almishhoda04/Titanic-Dataset_Preprocessing/refs/heads/main/Data_Cleaning_Preprocessing.csv]

# 📚 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Plotly (optional)**

# 📈 EDA Tasks Performed

- Loaded the cleaned dataset 
- Checked data structure, types, and missing values
- Created visualizations:
  - Histograms for numerical data distribution
  - Boxplots to detect outliers
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Pairplots to observe relationships
  - Countplots for categorical data like Gender, Passenger Class, Embarkation Port
  - Interactive histograms with Plotly (optional)

# 📊 Key Insights

- Majority of passengers embarked from port 'S'.
- Female passengers had a higher survival rate than males.
- 1st class passengers had the highest survival chances.
- Fare distribution is right-skewed with a few high outliers.
- Positive correlation between Fare and Pclass.
